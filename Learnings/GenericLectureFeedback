Week1_feedback

Lectures were interesting compared to the traditional method which others follow.
I really enjoy the class, most probably due to the productive class works and interactive way of teaching!
I might have gone outside during the class but it was not because i was bored or didn't like the lecture.
Its the hydrolic pressure which compells me to go outside. (sorry to mention that!)

To be honest, i have one problem!
One thing which i didn't like is that even if someone is not interested in higher studies,
he/she has to go through research papers and it is painful atleast for me.

If majority of students have the same issue then i would like you to look into the matter.
My suggestion in that case will be that only interested students should be taken into condideration for 
research related projects.

Thank you!

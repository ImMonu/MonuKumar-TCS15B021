Week1_report

well, frist week was awesome.

I got to read one of the research papers(Turing article) as part of the assignment.
I was supposed to read the Turing article by John E Hopcroft (Turing award winner 1986).

The article was entitled 'COMPUTER SCIENCE: THE EMERGENCE OF A DESCIPLINE'.

It was quite fascinating to know how the descipline evolved with time.
He has worked in the following areas:
1.Formal language theory 
2.Automata theory
3.Graph models
4.Data structures and algorithms.

-I have not discussed with friends but explained him about my article.
 I have googled the works of his area and gathered quite a bit of knowledge/information regarding the same.

-It is a rapid evovlving science.

overall it was a nice experience.

 I read the article "what next? A dozen goals in information technology".
 It was quite intersting to go through the article because it contained interesting goals which could be achieved in the future.
 I also learnt about language Haskell.

 I installed python and ran some sample codes.
 I also learnt more about compilers and interpreters.

 week4_report
 
 I learnt about developing interpreter.
 I tried samples using python.

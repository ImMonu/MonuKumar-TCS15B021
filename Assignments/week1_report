It was not surprising to hear that we haven't learnt much.
well, frist week was awesome.

I got to read one of the research papers(Turing article) as part of the assignment.
I was supposed to read the Turing article by John E Hopcroft (Turing award winner 1986).
The article was entitled 'COMPUTER SCIENCE: THE EMERGENCE OF A DESCIPLINE'.
Although boring, but it was quite fascinating to know how the descipline evolved with time.

He has worked in the following areas
1.Formal language theory 
2.Automata theory
3.Graph models
4.Data structures and algorithms.

His another area of research included the comparison of algorithm.
Comparison of algorithms in early days bssed on 
1.total running time which depends on computer performance.
2.the programming efficency 
3.growth rate of running time as the inputs get longer

John recognized that as computers became faster and workes on larger problems, 
the most important part to understand was the last one,the growth rate of running time.

He explored efficient structurs for storing data in a computer and created efficient algorithms
for storing the problems they could represent.

His current work, which uses graph models explores ways to track social networks 
and build the search engines of the future.

I also went through the language clojure briefly.

overall it was a nice experience.
